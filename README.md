# My Fancy Bank
## Description
      Your assignment, should you choose to accept it, is to build me a bank that I can manage.  
    
      My bank will offer my customers the ability to create checking and savings accounts, maintain 
    deposits in at least three different currencies, and take out loans if (they have collateral).
    
      I want my bank to be highly service oriented, just as long as I never have to deal with my customers 
    in person.  
    
      My bank is going to be a true on-line bank. My customers should be able to do everything they need 
    to do from the fancy ATM that you will create for me.  
    
      Through the ATM, my customers should be able to create any type of account they want – savings or 
    checking, request a loan, and view their transactions and current balances. 
    
      The bank manager off course (that’s me!) should have the ability to check-up on a specific 
    customer, all my customers – especially my poor ones who owe my money! I should also be able to 
    get a daily report on transactions for that day.  
    
      My goal for providing this service is to make money! I will charge a fee every time an account 
    is opened or closed and a fee every time a checking account transaction or any withdrawal is 
    made. I will only pay interest on savings accounts that have high balances, but I will charge 
    interest on all loans! I do not care about having happy customers, I want to make money!  
## Overall requirements:

1. The main requirement is a strong and robust object model.
2. A strong and easy to use user interface for the bank manager (that’s me) and my customers who I never want to see.
3. My bank re-adjusts every day, so you don’t have to worry about a database or file component to save customer information for this assignment.
4. The banker should have the ability to get a fully daily report or a report that just gives me an update from the last time I ran the report.
